        <h2>Computer Science Comprehensive Major</h2>
        <P>Honestly, I genuinely love my major, and would be happy with most any job in the CompSci field!</P>
        <h3>Super Senior (5th year, first semester, and hopefully graduating in December)!</h3>
        <p>I already know the basics of HTML and CSS from CS 268 - Web Systems. From this class, I hope to learn how to take those basic skills and better use them to create functional, pretty websites. Graphic design is NOT my area of expertise.</p>
        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>Music and baseball</p>
