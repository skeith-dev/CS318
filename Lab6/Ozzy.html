            <h2>Ozzy</h2>
            <p>Ozzy was the Keith family dog until his passing in October of 2021. He was a pug-border terrier mix that we adopted when he was three years old.<br><br>Ozzy was very silly, as can be plainly seen by his appearance. He loved napping, begging for food, and going on walks, amongst many other things.<br><br>He was truly the best dog that anyone or any family could ask for, and he is missed every day.</p>
