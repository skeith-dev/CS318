            <h2>Mystery</h2>
            <p>Mystery is my partner and I's dog, who we adopted last fall from the Eau Claire Humane Society. She is currently two years old.<br><br>Mystery is <em>very</em> playful, but also very cuddly. She loves to play with her toys, and to go on long bike rides around Eau Claire.<br><br>Mystery is still young and mischeivious, but she has a heart of gold and loves my partner and I as much as we love her. That is to say, a lot!</p>
